# Durable queue benchmarks

Benchmarks for Redis-backed job queues: VarMQ's persistent and distributed
queues against Asynq, rmq, taskq and gocraft/work, with a raw Redis list as the
floor. It lives in its own Go module so the other libraries' dependencies (some
pull in go-redis v8) stay out of the root `go.mod`.

## Run

```sh
task durable-up           # Redis 7.2 on localhost:6390, no volume
task durable-test         # smoke tests
task durable-bench-quick  # every benchmark once (-benchtime=1x)
task durable-down
```

Set `REDIS_URL` to use another Redis (default `redis://localhost:6390/0`). The
tests and benchmarks skip when it isn't reachable. `FLUSHDB` runs before every
iteration, so don't point it at a Redis you care about.

## Dimensions

- Workloads: `1u-100Kt` (1 producer x 100,000 jobs), `100u-1Kt` (100 x 1,000)
- Workers per instance: 10, 100, 1000. Instances: 1, 4 (VarMQ's persistent
  queue supports 1 only, so it has no `C4` rows)
- Tasks: `Noop`, `Sleep1ms`
- Names: `BenchmarkDurable/<Task>W<workers>C<instances>/<workload>/<subject>`,
  `BenchmarkEnqueue/<workload>/<subject>`,
  `BenchmarkLatency/NoopW10C1/1u-10Kt/<subject>`
- Metrics: `jobs/s` (Durable, Enqueue); `p50-ms`, `p99-ms`, `max-ms` (Latency)

Each subject runs at its library defaults, apart from worker concurrency and
the Redis pool size (`max(workers, 10*GOMAXPROCS)`, where the library lets us
set it). Anything else a library forces us to choose is listed under
"Forced settings".

## Work per job

| Subject | Ack on hot path | Wake mechanism | Idle wait | Round trips per job | Serialization | Pool size | Forced settings |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|-----------|---------------------|---------------|-----------|-----------------|
| RawRedis | none | blocking pop | `BRPOP` 1 s block timeout | 1 | raw JSON bytes | `poolSize(workers)` | none |
